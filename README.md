### About
This is an Image Scanning webapp built using a Python library called Streamlit and uses Firebase as a database system. User can use this website to retrieve meaningful text from images such as email, mobile number and website links. It also provides a feature where users can view the history of their search results.

### How to implement on your local machine
To run this webapp on your device, you need to install the following python modules:
   <br> -easyocr
   <br>-streamlit
   <br>-numpy
   <br>-pyrebase
   <br>-Pillow
   <br>-firebase
  
After installing all these modules, you need to run the code on your device using "streamlit run" command and you are good to go!

### Experience on this task
This task was a bit challenging for me. I started developing an android app using flutter but was unable to implement it as one of the google ML Vision packages was not working properly. Then I came across the Streamlit library of python which is great for creating a webapp. I have also used Firebase as a database system to retrieve the history of scanned images.
